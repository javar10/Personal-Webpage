      <p>
        I live with my husband and our two children, Lia and Ryan.

      <h2>Education and Career</h2>
      <p>
        My education and career is one marked by many paths.
        I graduated from the University of Virginia with a bachelor's in architecture, but quickly decided that field wasn't for me.
        In search of something more altruistic, I joined the Peace Corps where I served as an English Teaching Volunteer in Panama.
        Upon completing my service, I continued in the field of education and became an ESOL teacher.
        After a decade in education, I happened upon the world of programming while tinkering in Arduino.
        From there, I had found a new passion.
        My current career goal is to become a software developer in the field of EdTech.
        I want to create engaging games for learners of all backgrounds so they can also discover their passions.
